## Summary
Declare **Python 3.6** as the minimum Python version supported.


## Motivation
Python ecosystem is moving forward,
[Python 3.5 has reached EOL](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0478/), and some
core Conan dependencies will stop to support it, like
[requests >2.25](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/community/updates/#id1).

Python 3.6 has also [some valuable features](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.6.html)
that will help to improve the codebase and write more maintainable source:

 * Formatted string literals a.k.a. _f-strings_.
 * Type hints for classes and instance variables.


## Proposal
Python 3.6 will be the minimal supported version. Conan 2.0 is expected to be released
on 2021, by that date Python 3.6 will be the oldest release alive (EOL on December 2021) and
[Python 3.10 will be already released (October 2021)](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0619/).

About Linux distros: starting on Debian 10 Buster (July 2019), the [Python 3
version installed is Python 3.7](https://wiki.debian.org/Python). Ubuntu 18.04 (April 2018) already included Python 3.6.


## Alternative Approaches
Newer Python versions provide several enhancements on type annotation that could help
to write and maintain code and some nice language features, but those are not _needed_
and can block Conan 2.0 from being deployed on some wide-spread systems.


## Detailed Design
As soon as we include some f-string in the sources, the test suite will start to fail
for any Python version older than 3.6.


## Open issues
Not known yet.


## Future Extensions
Not applicable.
